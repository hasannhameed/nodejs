Now it's time to put your skills to the test by creating a Student & Course Portal using Express.js. This project will strengthen your understanding of CRUD operations, routing, and handling dynamic parameters in Express!




Deliverables:

Build an Express server with:





Set Up an Express Server that listens on a specified port.



Use Express Router to modularize your routes.



Create basic endpoints for students and courses.



Handle dynamic requests using req.params.id.



Implement a custom 404 Not Found handler for invalid routes.




Features & API Endpoints





Home Route:



/ - Welcome message.



Student Routes:



/students - List all students.



/students/:id - Fetch a student by ID.



Course Routes:



/courses - List all courses.



/courses/:id - Fetch a course by ID.



404 Handling:



Handle invalid routes with a "Page not found" message.




Note:

Make use of req.params.id for working with /:id

The code has been provided with default values for students and courses which will be used for fetching the values.




Use the following data: (Right now we are using demo data but in real time we'll be using the data that is fetched from the server)

Students Data

const students = [

{ id: 1, name: "Alice" },

{ id: 2, name: "Bob" },

{ id: 3, name: "Charlie" }

];

Courses Data

const courses = [

{ id: 1, name: "Frontend", description: "HTML, CSS, JS, React" },

{ id: 2, name: "Backend", description: "Node.js, Express, MongoDB" }

];
