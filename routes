Node.js
Complete Your E-Commerce API with Controllers!
You're now ready to build a fully functional E-Commerce API that manages Users, Products, and Shopping Carts! 🎯

This time, you'll use controllers to keep your code organized, modular, and scalable.



You are required to implement the routes using controllers to handle the logic for each resource.


Task Overview
🔹 Implement routes using controllers for:

Users (userController.js)
